# messages.properties - legacy/localization bundle (UTF-8)
# Added per migration task: ensure MessageSource resolves legacy key and preserves legacy literal.
# TODO: (REVIEW) This file intentionally contains the legacy literal to preserve behavior during migration.
# If full i18n is introduced later, consider moving this entry to locale-specific files (e.g., messages_pt_BR.properties)
# and adjust tests/controllers to rely on localized values instead of explicit defaults.
